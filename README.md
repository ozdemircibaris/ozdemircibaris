I am a Front-End Developer with 5 years of experience. I spent most of my time with Javascript and TypeScript in this process. I am experienced in popular Javascript Frameworks such as  ReactJS, NextJS, and NodeJS.
I like to challenge with the occasional backend challenges. It gets me into end-to-end thinking.
Even though Iâ€™m just at the beginning of the road, I will always have an effort to improve myself.
